# CUDA-FFT
implementation of Parallel FFT on CUDA

This is an FFT implementation based on CUDA. 
It also includes a CPU version of the FFT and a general polynomial multiplication method. 
The documentation is currently in Chinese, as I have some things to do for a while, but I will translate it to English and upload it later. 

If you need to access the CUDA-based FFT, it can be found in the "cuda" folder.
If you need to access the CPU-based FFT, it can be found in the "cpp" folder.
If you require the naive version of polynomial multiplication, it is located in the "n2" file.
To use it, please refer to the instruction manual: "说明文档.txt"
